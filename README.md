# A Tidied Version of the 2016 ANES

This data set is a practice data set for my undergraduate research
methods class.

Once you’ve started a *New Project…* in RStudio and created a `data/`
sub-directory in the project directory, you can add this data set to the
`data/` subdirectory.

You can download the data set by clicking the instructions below.

-   For the CSV version, right-click on this
    [link](https://github.com/pos3713ri/3713ri-anes/raw/main/data/anes-2016.csv)
    and choose *Save Link As…*. Save the file to the `data/`
    subdirectory on your computer. The CSV file does not store
    information about factor levels, so you may prefer the RDS version.
-   For the RDS version, right-click on this
    [link](https://github.com/pos3713ri/3713ri-anes/raw/main/data/anes-2016.rds)
    and choose *Save Link As…*. Save the file to the `data/`
    subdirectory on your computer. The CSV file does not store
    information about factor levels, so you may prefer the RDS version.

Once you’ve added the data set to the `data/` subdirectory, you can load
it in RStudio with the following:

``` r
# load packages
library(tidyverse)

# load data
anes <- read_rds("data/anes-2016.rds")

# quick look
glimpse(anes)
```

The variables with the prefix `ft_` are feeling thermometers, which are
asked in the following way:

> I’d like to get your feelings toward some of our political leaders and
> other people who are in the news these days. I’ll read the name of a
> person and I’d like you to rate that person using something we call
> the feeling thermometer.

> Ratings between 50 degrees and 100 degrees mean that you feel
> favorable and warm toward the person. Ratings between 0 degrees and 50
> degrees mean that you don’t feel favorable toward the person and that
> you don’t care too much for that person. You would rate the person at
> the 50 degree mark if you don’t feel particularly warm or cold toward
> the person.

> If we come to a person whose name you don’t recognize, you don’t need
> to rate that person. Just tell me and we’ll move on to the next one.

For example, the variable `ft_black_lives_matter` asks respondents to
rate their feelings toward the Black Lives Matter movement from 0 (very
cold) to 100 (very warm).

The remaining variables are (hopefully) names well enough to
self-explain.
